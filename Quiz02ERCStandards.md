# Challenge 2 - __Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) STANDARDS__

## READ >> CODE
_Here, we move our game up with some real blockchain heavyweight; __the ERC standards__._

Before coding an ERC Standard, we need to know what are the EIPs and whats the rationale behind them.

### Reading Uniswap
You will first read about the major tokens used across Ethereum blockchain as a medium of value
  * ERC20
  * ERC721
  * ERC1155

```  
  Task 01: Deploy 2 ERC-20 tokens 
  * (Be creative with their names, total supply, symbols etc!) 
  * Have fun with these tokens. Mint some to yourself, transfer it among different accounts etc. 
  
  Sub-Task 01: Use approvals to transfer 1st token by an account that does not own those tokens.
```

  NFT, here we go again!
```
  Task 02: Make an NFT contract with the following features;
  * Anyone can mint
  * Price = 5 token A or 10 token B or 0.05 eth. The NFT should be mintable using either of the 3 currencies.
  * A royalty fee of 1% fee to be given to the developer of the NFT contract on each mint and sale of each NFT.
  * Owner of the contract should be able to withdraw all the ether, token A, and token B from the contract.
```

  Did you know that your contract can send and withdraw ethers? That’s what this task is all about. 
```
  Task 04: Make a function that receives ethers on a successful ticket booking. 
  (Hint: You’ll need to to add a certain modifier to the function)
```

### Reading Uniswap
Search about; what are AMMs, what is Uniswap, what is Liquidity, what is Yield Farming? [Find help here](https://www.youtube.com/c/Finematics)
  * What did Uniswap V1 offer?
  * Difference between Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V3.

_Note: Uniswap reading is compulsory as it is a prerequisite for the final project._
